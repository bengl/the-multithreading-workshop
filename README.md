# The Multithreading Workshop

Node.js's single-threaded nature is a common misconception.

While this held true in the past, today, Node.js effectively utilizes an event loop and asynchronous programming techniques to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

However, it's very easy to do multithreading the wrong way. In this workshop, we'll explore best practices and tools to supercharge Node.js multithreading.

## Getting started
